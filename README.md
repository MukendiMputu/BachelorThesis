## DSL-Driven Generation of User Documentation for Web Applications

This thesis work propose a solution for automatically generating end-user documentation for web application by means of a graphical domain-specific language (DSL).We develope an application for modeling different user action sequences in a web application using the Cinco SCCE Meta Tooling Framework and subsequently generate an end-user documentation in markdown syntax. The Cinco framework is a generator-driven development environment for domain-specific graphical modeling tools.  It is based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework and Graphiti Graphical Tooling Infrastructure,  but aims to hide much of their complexity and intricate APIs (More information can be found at [here](https://cinco.scce.info/).
