\section{Motivation and Background}
One of the most challenging tasks is software development is developing a long-term strategy for creating, managing and updating the documentation for the end users as the software product develops, adapts or increases in complexity. The challenge lies in the fact that the developer team, consisting of one or more person, tasked to document the software have to do it manually by first selecting the information with the most value to the end users, structuring it and then when required updating it.\\
In other words, the developer has to reproduce the steps or whole scenarios a potential end user would go trough and document where useful information are to be provided, in order to reduce the time needed to understand the main functionality of the software product. Completing this process once does not necessarily free the developer from the task, it is a life cycle that has to be repeated every time
