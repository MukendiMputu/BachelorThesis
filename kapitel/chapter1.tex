\chapter{Fundamentals of Mode-Driven Development with CINCO}\label{ch:Basis}

This chapter lays down the preliminaries of the \acrfull{mdd} using the CINCO SCCE Meta Tooling Framework, as well as the steps necessary to get up and running with the framework.
The term \acrshort{mdd} refers to software development paradigm where the functionalities of the software are first specified as models, from which then actual code can be generated.
To create and use models for representing the software system, a \acrfull{dsl} that is close to the problem domain, is needed; that means the domain experts and programmers have to agree on a specification language that determines syntax and semantic of the model elements. 
After a short introduction to \acrfull{mdd} in section~\hyperref[]{1}, we will show how \acrshort{mdd} is realized using CINCO\@.
