\chapter{Cinco Product Application}\label{ch:CP}
Having described the meta-level of the user documentation model, we come now to the description of the graphical model instantiated from it. The goal of this chapter is to explain the the appearance and behavior of the various model elements. First, we give a strict definition of a graphical DSL, then illustrate the fundamental building blocks of our documentation model. Later on, we demonstrate the use of these graphical elements to specify the important configuration of the website that we want to document. At the end, we show how using the editor built-in generator, a project structure, that constitute the target application, is generated.
