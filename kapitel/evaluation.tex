\chapter{Evaluation}\label{ch:eval}
The purpose of this chapter is to elaborate on our approach and its outcome. Initially, we justify the decision for the chosen approach to consider the topic, as well as the challenges identified and the solutions found to overcome them. A brief description of the applied design pattern and the gained advantages is also given. Afterwards, we demonstrate how the minimal setup of the system to get started with the development. On top of that present the resulting application with a quick demonstration on how to acquire and start it. Finally, we provide a discussion of the overall results and eventual alternatives approaches.
