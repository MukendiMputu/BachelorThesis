It defines the documentation process from the viewpoint of the documentation developer. It also covers the documentation product. It specifies the structure, content, and format for user documentation, and also provides informative guidance for user documentation style. It is independent of the software tools that may be used to produce documentation, and applies to both printed documentation and on-screen documentation. Much of this standard is also applicable to user documentation for systems including hardware.},

@inproceedings{ieee6081814,
	abstract = {The relevance of end user documentation for improving usability, learnability and operability of software applications is well known. However, software processes often devote little effort to the production of end user documentation due to budget and time constraints, or leave it not up-to-date as new versions of the application are produced. In particular, in the field of Web applications, due to their quick release time and the rapid evolution, end user documentation is often lacking, or it is incomplete and of poor quality. In this paper a semi-automatic approach for user documentation generation of Web 2.0 applications is presented. The approach exploits dynamic analysis techniques for capturing the user visible behaviour of a web application and, hence, producing end user documentation compliant with known standards and guidelines for software user documentation. A suite of tools support the approach by providing facilities for collecting user session traces associated with use case scenarios offered by the Web application, for abstracting a Navigation Graph of the application, and for generating tutorials and procedure descriptions. The obtained documentation is provided in textual and hypertextual formats. In order to show the feasibility and usefulness of the approach, an example of generating the user documentation for an existing Web application is presented in the paper.},

With markup languages, you might annotate your text with information about where chapters and sections start, but not how chapter and heading captions should be formatted, although you can specify this with stylesheets. This approach decouples the structure of a document from how it is visualised and makes it easier for you to produce different kinds of output. Pandoc is a tool that lets you translate between different document formats, including from Markdown to formats such as LaTeX, HTML, and Markdown. This booklet describes how to write in Markdown and use Pandoc to produce formatted documents.},
