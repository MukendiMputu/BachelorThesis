  abstract  = {We present DIME, an integrated solution for the rigorous model-driven development of sophisticated web applications based on the Dynamic Web Application (DyWA) framework, that is designed to accelerate the realization of requirements in agile development environments. DIME provides a family of Graphical Domain-Specific Languages (GDSLs), each of which is tailored towards a specific aspect of typical web applications, including persistent entities (i.e., a data model), business logic in form of various types of process models, the structure of the user interface, and access control. They are modeled on a high level of abstraction in a simplicity-driven fashion that focuses on describing what application is sought, instead of how the application is realized. The choice of platform, programming language, and frameworks is moved to the corresponding (full) code generator.},

  abstract  = {We present the jABC, a framework for model driven application development based on Lightweight Process Coordination. With jABC, users (product developers and system/software designers) easily develop services and applications by composing reusable building-blocks into hierarchical (flow-) graph structures that are executable models of the application. This process is supported by an extensible set of plugins providing additional functionalities, so that the jABC models can be animated, analyzed, simulated, verified, executed and compiled. This way of handling the collaborative design of complex software systems has proven to be effective and adequate for the cooperation of non-programmers and technical people, and it is now being rolled out in the operative practice.},

  abstract  = {We show our approach for the definition of Domain Specific Languages integrating both graphical and textual views. The approach is based on the meta-modelling concepts provided by the AToM3 tool. In this way, the language designer starts building the meta-model of the complete language. Then, he can select (possibly overlapping) submodels of the meta-model to define the different diagram types (i.e. language viewpoints). By default, the viewpoint is assigned a graphical concrete syntax, although a textual one can also be given. This is performed by selecting (or creating) triple graph grammar rules to translate from the viewpoint meta-model to a DSL called Textual that contains the most common elements of textual languages (such as expressions or operators). From a Textual model, a parser is automatically generated, where the semantic actions of the EBNF grammar are graph grammar rules, derived from the viewpoint meta-model. In this way, the parsing results in a model conformant to the viewpoint meta-model, which can be seamlessly integrated with other graphical and textual views.},
